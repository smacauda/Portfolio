## Data Wrangling

### Using Foursquare API to Determine the Best Neighborhoods in NYC to Open an Italian Restaurant

Italian restaurants were clustered by neighborhood and their overall ratings were examined to determine where there was a high demand that was being adequately satisfied. Demand was determined based on the number of restaurants in a given neighborhood. Neighborhoods that contained more than 3 Italian restaurants were determined to have a high demand. Satisfaction was determined based on the overall rating of Italian restaunrants in a given neighborhood. Those with ratings below 8.0 were considered to be unsatisfactory. 

## Data Visualization

### University of Michigan Men's Athletics Program Records by Year

Data visualization created using matplotlib with widget added to add/remove plots from the figure.
